/* === Advanced Selectors === */

/* Child and Sibling Combinators

    Elements can be accessed in different ways without referring to a class or id, some examples include:

    1. > - the child combinator (selects an element that is one level of indentation down)
    2. + - the adjacent sibling combinator (selects an element that is adjacent to the target, or on the same level of indentation)
    3. ~ - the general sibling combinator (selects all sibling elements that are following the target)

*/

main div {
  /* This would select all divs inside main (child and grand-child) */
}

/* === Child Combinator === */

main > div {
  /* This would select all divs with class "child" */
}

main > div > div {
  /* This would select all divs with class "grand-child" */
}

/* === Adjacent Sibling Combinator === */

.group1 + div {
  /* This would select the div with the classes "child group2" */
}

.group1 + div + div {
  /* This would select the div with classes "child group3" */
}

/* === General Sibling Combinator === */

.group1 ~ div {
  /* This would select all div siblings which would be "child group2" and "child group3" in this case */
}

/* === Pseudo Selectors === */

/* Pseudo Classes

    Pseudo classes can do a variety of things relating to the position on the page, the state of an element, or how a user is interacting with it, some examples include:
    1. Dynamic and user action classes - make the page feel more dynamic and interactive
    2. Structural classes - powerful way to select elements based on their position in the DOM

*/

/* Dynamic and User Action Pseudo Classes */

:focus {
  /* Applies to an element that is currently selected by the user */
}

:hover {
  /* Will affect anything under the users mouse pointer (useful for buttons / drop-downs) */
}

:active {
  /* Applies to elements that are currently being clicked (useful for interactive user feedback) */
}

:link {
  /* Applies to unvisited links */
}

:visited {
  /* Applies to links the user has already visited */
}

/* Structural Pseudo Classes */

:root {
  /* This represents the top level of the DOM (no parents and a good place for global CSS rules) */
}

:first-child {
  /* Applies to the first child of an element */
}

:last-child {
  /* Applies to the last child of an element */
}

:empty {
  /* Applies to elements with no child elements at all */
}

:only-child {
  /* Applies to elements that have no siblings */
}

/* :nth-child is more unique */

:nth-child(5) {
  /* Selects the 5th element */
}

:nth-child(3n) {
  /* Selects every 3rd element */
}

:nth-child(3n + 3) {
  /* Selects every 3rd element beginning with the 3rd */
}

:nth-child(even) {
  /* Selects every even element */
}

/* Pseudo Elements

    Pseudo elements affect parts of the HTML that are not directly elements themselves

*/

::marker {
  /* Selects the numbers or bullet points of lists (<li> elements) */
}

::first-letter {
  /* Style the first letter of some text */
}

::first-line {
  /* Style the first line of some text */
}

::selection {
  /* Styles the highlighting of text when user selects some text on the page */
}

::before {
  /* Adds extra elements onto the page before an element */
}

::after {
  /* Adds extra elements onto the page after an element */
}

/* === Attribute Selectors === */

/*

    Can be used to target specific attribute values, they are written differently as attributes are written by us, examples include:
    1. [attribute] - selects any element where the attribute exists (value doesnt matter)
    2. selector[attribute] - selects any selector where the attribute exists
    3. [attribute="value"] - selects the specified attribute with the specific value
    
*/

[src] {
  /* This will target any element with the src attribute */
}

img[src] {
  /* This will target only img elements that have an src attribute */
}

img[src="tree.jpg"] {
  /* This will target only img elements with an src attribute that has the value of "tree.jpg" */
}

/* More General Attribute Selectors

    1. [attribute^="value"] - Will match strings from the start (^=)
    2. [attribute$="value"] - Will match strings from the end ($=)
    3. [attribute*="value"] - Will match anywhere inside the string (*=)

*/

[class^="aus"] {
  /* This will target any class attribute that begins with "aus" such as class="australia", class="austria" */
}

[src$=".jpg"] {
  /* This will target any src attribute that ends in ".jpg", such as src="tree.jpg", src="dog.jpg" */
}

[for*="ill"] {
  /* This will target any for attribute that has "ill" anywhere inside it, such as for="bill", for="ill", for="silly", for="jill" */
}
