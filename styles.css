/* Child and Sibling Combinators

    Elements can be accessed in different ways without referring to a class or id, some examples include:

    1. > - the child combinator (selects an element that is one level of indentation down)
    2. + - the adjacent sibling combinator (selects an element that is adjacent to the target, or on the same level of indentation)
    3. ~ - the general sibling combinator (selects all sibling elements that are following the target)

main div {
  /* This would select all divs inside main (child and grand-child) */
}

/* === Child Combinator === */

main > div {
  /* This would select all divs with class "child" */
}

main > div > div {
  /* This would select all divs with class "grand-child" */
}

/* === Adjacent Sibling Combinator === */

.group1 + div {
  /* This would select the div with the classes "child group2" */
}

.group1 + div + div {
  /* This would select the div with classes "child group3" */
}

/* === General Sibling Combinator === */

.group1 ~ div {
  /* This would select all div siblings which would be "child group2" and "child group3" in this case */
}
